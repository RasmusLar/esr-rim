# Module dirty state checker.
# 
# Provides means to mark modules as "clean" and check if they become "dirty" later on. 
#
# Once a module has been marked as being clean, it will become dirty if
# any of the following is true:
#
# * Number of contained files has changed
# * File names or location have changed
# * File contents have changed
# * One of the RIM info attributes listed in ChecksumAttributes has changed
# * The RIM info file is missing or became invalid
#
# Ignored files are not considered by this check.
